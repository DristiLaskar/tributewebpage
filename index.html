                <h2>Dhyan Chand Award Recipient- Football Coach</h2>
                <p>Syed Abdul Rahim, widely known as Rahim Saab, was an Indian football player who later became a renowned coach and manager of the Indian national team from 1950 to 1963. He is credited as the mastermind behind the modernization of Indian football.

                    Born in 1909 in Hyderabad, British India, Rahim showcased his football skills while representing the Osmania University team during his graduation. He also played for a local team called “Eleven Hunters.”
                    
                    Rahim’s talent as a footballer led him to play professionally for Qamar Club, a highly regarded team in the local league. He even had the opportunity to play for HSV Hoek, a Dutch Amateur League club in the Netherlands, before transitioning into a managerial role.
                    
                    In 1943, Rahim was elected as the secretary of the Hyderabad Football Association and later became the secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Football Association. He then joined Hyderabad City Police FC as a coach.
                    
                    Besides his profession as a teacher, Rahim excelled as a motivator, and his coaching tenure is considered a “golden age” of Indian football. Under his guidance, the Indian football team achieved notable milestones, including reaching the semi-finals of the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, becoming the first Asian team to do so. His tenure also saw India win gold at the Asian Games in 1951 (Delhi) and 1962 (Jakarta), clinch the Colombo Cup in 1952 (Colombo) and 1954 (Calcutta), and secure the runners-up position in Pestabola Merdeka in 1959 (Kuala Lumpur).
                    
                    Abdul Rahim’s last major triumph with the Indian team came at the 1962 Asian Games held in Jakarta, where India defeated South Korea to claim the gold medal.
                    
                    A biopic on the life of this remarkable football coach titled “Maidaan,” featuring Ajay Devgan, is scheduled to be released.</p>
